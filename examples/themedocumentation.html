            <h5 class="description">For the style of the first theme we took  inspiration from the Greek inscriptions and, more specifically, from those of the classical period (V-IV a.C.). Why greek inscription? Because with the first epigraphs there was the diffusion of an alphabetic writing system in which at each phoneme corresponds a grapheme. This phenomenon was revolutionary because the previous forms of writing, where the signs still represented an object or an idea or a combination of syllables were abandoned. </h5>

              <h3>The features </h3>
              <p>The epigraphs were usually inscribed on durable materials such as stone or marble: text-shadow and opacity CSS properties allowed us to reproduce this effect on the screen.
              </p>
             <p>Ancient Geek is the font we used for the whole document since it seemed to us the most suitable to reproduce the epigraphic aspect of the characters in the classical period, characterized by a great composure and formal perfection. In addition, we decided to set the same font size for all the elements in order to keep the graphic homogeneity that characterizes the epigraphs. 
		    </p>
		    <p>
			Another important feature is the layout of the text, developed in Athens during the classical period, known as “stoichedico”. Each line of the text basically has the same number of characters and each letter of each line is placed vertically with respect to the corresponding letter of the next line, so as to create something like a grid. Css letter-spacing property was extremely useful to try to ricreate this feature.

            <h5 class="description">This theme is inspired by the notes of XVI Century scientists. In particular, Leonardo and his disciples- Cesare Cesariano, Francesco DI Giorgio Martini, Luca Pacioli. Their studies fully mirrored the concept of "scientia", as something that involves all disciplines.

              <h3>The naturalistic view</h3>
              <p>The theme features a parchment paper as the background, with a chosen font that simulates Leonardo's Handwriting. Images are side by side to text, as in Leonardo and his disciples' true notes. The vertical line beside the images is necessary to mirror how the scientists structured their notes- neat text that separates graphic content by this fine line. Because drawings at that time were as important as their description, hovering on them brings them back to life, revealing their true colors. Following the same logic, one of Leonardo's drawings is reproduced in the background, as a gif. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Proportions in the XVI century were taken very seriously: underneath them, it was possible to look at the geometric figures God had chosen to create Earth and its living creatures. This belief is represented in the page layout of Leonardo and his disciples' notes: a column reserved to drawings, a central part to describe their observations, a footer to summarize and add content that did not belong to the main text.
              </p>
              <p>XVI scientists'notes surprisingly taught us a lot about design. One of the articles on the matter can be found here: redundancy is key when studying concepts, use your imagination and any sketch needs annotation.

Her reign was known as the Victorian era and is popular because of writesrs as Charles Dickens.

		    <p>The Victorian era conveys a distinct typographic heritage linked indelibly to heavy “Egyptian” Slab serifs and Clarendons. The calligraphic scripts were also widely used in this specific period. The headlines that inspired me were the ones of some English newspapers in that era which were written all in uppercase, using a font that is richly decorated with some bigger than the usual letter spacing in between and having a drop cap in different style at the beginning of each paragraph.              </p>
              <p>Calligraphic scripts that work are difficult to come by, but Aquiline Two makes a pretty good stab at recreating antique-style handwriting, exactly because of this reason I chose it for this project. 
              </p>
<p>Apart from the above sources of inspiration in regards to the choice of colors, I have chosen the typical royal violet and crimson. All of the images are transformed in  black and white in order to correspond to the certain period and bring some nostalgia about it. The borders of the images are rounded because from the layout examples that I have used for inspiration, I found out that they preferred sharped and remembering type of font and uppercase headline, but in  regards to the images was preferred the more subtle approach – smaller images, rounded borders. Sometime even the font was put around rounded images as in the example of the cover of the book of Charles Dickens, The Christmas Carol.              </p>
           <p>My text is positioned in one column and reminds of the style of writing a letter. The letters in this period were still really popular as a form of correspondence. Each of my paragraphs starts with a drop cap, which was a top trend in that period. For the drop cap was used a font which is rich in decorations and makes the first letter stand out from the rest of the paragraph. In my case I decided to go even further and put it in different color from the rest of the text, so that here we have also a connection with the novel the Scarlet letter, also written in the Victorian era.

              <p>
                However, there are some additions that reflect the Dessau period too, as Bauhaus has recently turned 100. You can find them out 
                resizing the screen and pushing the three buttons for three colour combinations. Bauhaus artists worked a lot on complementary colours,
                and we tried to recreate those studied by Josef Albers and Piet Mondrian.

              <p>Other important features are the use of photographs instead of illustration; and, most importantly, the deployment of a mathematically determined grid to determine the placement of design elements—a method that remains extremely important to this day in web design.The ‘50s are characterised by the use of light and very intense colours.

<p>Apart from this in the 90s the world became much more open-minded and the young people wanted to be more provocative and express their mindset  better by wearing neon colors, which were making them stand out in the crowd. Because of this fashion trend I have used  quite a lot these colors that remind me of the start of something new and setting end to the traditional colors, but trying something more expressive and provocative.</p>
		    <p>The layout of my paragraph was inspired by the game Tetris where you have different blocks in bright neon colors and you have to set them at the right place. Scrolling through this topic the user could get an experience of being in a game when reading a normal article exactly because of the unusual positioning of the paragraphs, seeming as if they are floating on the screen and the vivid colors of the fonts as well as the borders of the images that also remind us a well-known game Pac-Man.</p>
		    <p>The fonts used in this stylesheet could be considered as belonging to the large group of the so-called Computer fonts. They are quite more subtle, with straight lines, almost lacking any decoration. However, they are distinctive and well representing the technological progress in this era and the focus on different further technological improvements.

			     <p>What are the trends for the next few years? No one can say. What we tried to do was analyze the present and translate it into something better starting from our personal experience. We tried to achieve a balance between minimalism and brutalism in order to ensure the readability and usability on one hand, and to create visual tension on the other to grab person’s attention, as Pangram Pangram Foundry suggests.  </p>

				 <p> As it is clear, fonts play a major role in such a design. The bolder the better, as they say—and with typography, there’s no limit to how loud you can be. We used VelodromaBasic, a wide, loud, san serif font and we put it in bold in order to let the convayed message to scream and shout. But the widest is not the only thing you get with Velodroma. You get regular and wide too in one font, so you can combine them together. Indeed, we also see sans serifs as a new standard for “clean” work. As Papaelias says, “Modern San Serifs have become a voice for the non-corporate mainstream voice like Helvetica”. </p>

				 <p>By adding a dashed border to each paragraph, we wanted to make the composition look ordered, airy and soft and we tried to put into practice the so- called theory of loci, according to which we can we can memorize things more easily when we associate them with a specific place. The :hover selector and CSS animations gave us the ability to create a dynamic, interactive design which wants to make feel the reader involved. In addition, we tried to create a 3D effect on the text. using text-shadow CSS property and groove style for borders. </p>

            <p>The prediction we have made from 2040 and beyond is that we will get some result from the search on aliens by looking them as intelligent civilizations. As the internet transformed society over the past few decades, it will give us the capacity to process more data about ourselves, the planet we live on, and the universe than has ever before been possible. So, it is assumed that alien-produced electromagnetic signals will be discovered by 2040.

                <p>”Brain chip implants which will be capable of reading the brain's signals, or stimulating the brain with its own signals will be used by almost everyone. With these chips, the people will be able to get the alien-produced signals and communicate them as it is shown with a ‘voice recognition image’ inside the documents.</p>
              <p>VR-optimized websites will allow even more possibilities for interactive storytelling. An animation of an alien is added for the representation of interactive storytelling.</p>

              <p>As font family, <i>What Planet Are You From</i> has been used to give a representation of solar system. Thinking the box as it is seen from hologram projector, serif is used in terms of readability. UFO (probably there will be another name by then) with its light is put as holigram projector and the articles are shown under it.
