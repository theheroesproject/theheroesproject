              <h3>So what does the new record for the lowest level of winter ice actually mean</h3>
              <p>The Arctic Ocean freezes every winter and much of the sea-ice then thaws every summer, and that process will continue whatever happens with climate change. Even if the Arctic continues to be one of the fastest-warming regions of the world, it will always be plunged into bitterly cold polar dark every winter. And year-by-year, for all kinds of natural reasons, there’s huge variety of the state of the ice.
              </p>
              <p>
                For a start, it does not automatically follow that a record amount of ice will melt this summer. More important for determining the size of the annual thaw is the state of the weather as the midnight sun approaches and temperatures rise. But over the more than 30 years of satellite records, scientists have observed a clear pattern of decline, decade-by-decade.

              <p>The theme features a parchment paper as the background, with a chosen font that simulates Leonardo's Handwriting. Images are side by side to text, as in Leonardo and his disciples' true notes. The vertical line beside the images is necessary to mirror how the scientists structured their notes- neat text that separates graphic content by this fine line. Because drawings at that time were as important as their description, hovering on them brings them back to life, revealing their true colors. Following the same logic, one of Leonardo's drawings is reproduced in the background, as a gif. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Proportions in the XVI century were taken very seriously: underneath them, it was possible to look at the geometric figures God had chosen to create Earth and its living creatures. This belief is represented in the page layout of Leonardo and his disciples' notes: a column reserved to drawings, a central part to describe their observations, a footer to summarize and add content that did not belong to the main text.
              </p>
              <p>XVI scientists'notes surprisingly taught us a lot about design. One of the articles on the matter can be found here: redundancy is key when studying concepts, use your imagination and any sketch needs annotation.

                However, there are some additions that reflect the Dessau period too, as Bauhaus has recently turned 100. You can find them out 
                resizing the screen and pushing the three buttons for three colour combinations. Bauhaus artists worked a lot on complementary colours,
                and I tried to recreate those studied by Josef Albers and Piet Mondrian.

Swiss Design was a movement that took hold in the 1950s in two Swiss art schools, the kunstgewerbeschule in Zurich, led by Josef Müller-Brockmann, and the Allgemeine Gewerbeschule in Basel, led by Armin Hofmann.

              <p>Other important features are the use of photographs instead of illustration; and, most importantly, the deployment of a mathematically determined grid to determine the placement of design elements—a method that remains extremely important to this day in web design.The ‘50s are characterised by the use of light and very intense colours.

              <p>Josef Müller Brockmann is one of the most important graphic designers of Swiss Style in the 1950s. Here are some of his works:
